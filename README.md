_Recursive Wang Tiles_ (RWT) can be used to create an infinite, well-distributed, and progressive sequence of point samples.  They were introduced in [Kopf 2006](http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~dcor/articles/2006/Recursive-Wang.pdf).

This repo simply republishes Jose Esteve's incredibly useful RWT  dataset in binary form, and provides a two-file C library for parsing the binary data.

Jose, if you're reading this: THANK YOU.  Your [stippling repo](https://github.com/joesfer/Stippling) and [blog post](http://www.joesfer.com/?p=108) are awesome!
