_Recursive Wang Tiles_ (RWT) can be used to create an infinite, well-distributed, and progressive sequence of point samples.  They were introduced by [Kopf 2006](http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~dcor/articles/2006/Recursive-Wang.pdf).

This repo makes Kopf's dataset available via GitHub Pages, and provides a two-file C library for using the data.
