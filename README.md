_Recursive Wang Tiles_ (RWT) can be used to create an infinite, well-distributed, and progressive sequence of point samples.  They were introduced by Kopf's 2006 paper, which is included in the **ref** folder, as well as some of the paper's supplemental materials.

This repo makes Kopf's dataset available via GitHub Pages, and provides a two-file C library for using the data.
