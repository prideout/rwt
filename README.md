_Recursive Wang Tiles_ (RWT) can be used to create an infinite, well-distributed, and progressive sequence of point samples.  They were introduced by Kopf's 2006 paper, which is included in this repo, as well as some of the paper's supplemental materials.

This repo makes Kopf's dataset available via GitHub Pages at the following URL:
